January 2003: version 0.1 - first release for developers
========================================================


SHORT-TERM TECHNICAL ISSUES
---------------------------

* Solve the problem that slower FTP sites cannot be reached sometimes with net2ftp
  This function may help: ftp_set_option(FTP_TIMEOUT_SEC)

* Test if the application works 
    - without a database, if this is set in settings.inc.php
    - with register_globals set to off
    - on PHP > 4.0.6
    - on other platforms (Linux, *BSD, Windows, Mac OS X)
  and fix the possible problems

* Include different skins with the application

* Add compression of the HTML output, if the browser supports it.
  This should do the trick: ob_start("ob_gzhandler")

* Check - if the HTML that is outputted is really standards compliant, 
        - if it can be used by disabled people, and 
        - if it works in text browsers like "lynx" (who uses text browsers anyway, nowadays...)
  Nathanael will then finally stop bugging me with this...

* There is a function that maps the FTP server and directory, to the WEB (HTTP) server and directory.

  It is used on the Browse screen, when a user clicks on the filename, a new window opens in 
  which that file is executed from its WEB (not FTP) server.

  This function works perfectly if a domain name is used (eg ftp.mysite.com/dir/file.php is mapped to http://www.mysite.com/dir/file.php).
  However, this function has to be adapted on a case-by-case basis for most free hosts, because the mapping is different for each host.
  Some examples:
       ftp.freeserver.com/username/dir/file.php   can be mapped to   http://username.freeserver.com/dir/file.php
                                                                     http://www.freeserver.com/username/dir/file.php
                                                                     http://freeusers.freeserver.com//~username/dir/file.php
  On the homepage, there should be a note for this, both for the users of free webhosts, and for the free webhosts, which would like
  their FTP server to be reachable using net2ftp


LONG-TERM GOALS
---------------

* Re-think the screen sequences, to improve usability 
  For example, to upload many files, this is the screen sequence:
      browse --> upload form --> upload result --> browse --> upload form --> upload result --> browse --> ...
  By including the upload form on the result page as well, the user does not have to go back to the Browse screen, and
  again to the Upload screen. This would be the new sequence of screens:
      browse --> upload form -->          upload result (with form)       -->          upload result (with form) --> ...

* Uploading and downloading a large number of files is a pain. Zip upload and download could solve this.
      Upload: the files are grouped into a zip file on the client computer; they are decompressed on the net2ftp server and sent
              to the FTP server.
      Download: the files are taken from the FTP server, grouped and compressed to a single zip file on the net2ftp server and
                sent to the client computer.

* Allow the copy of the main FTP server to a second FTP server.
  This can be handy when developing a site on one server, and when it has to be moved to production on another server.
